# Advent-of-Code-2025

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges. Each day's challenge is implemented in a separate file within the `Day<x>` directory, where `<x>` corresponds to the day number.

I tried to use different programming languages for different days to broaden my skill set and experience with various programming paradigms.

| Day | Language |
|:---:|:--------:|
|  1  |    C     |
|  2  |   Rust   |
|  3  |   C++    |
|  4  |   Java   |
|  5  |  Python  |
|  6  |   C++    |
|  7  |    C     |
